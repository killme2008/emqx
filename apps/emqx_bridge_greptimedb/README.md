# emqx_bridge_greptimedb
This application houses the GreptimeDB data integration to EMQX.
It provides the means to connect to GreptimeDB and publish messages to it.

It implements connection management and interaction without the need for a
 separate connector app, since it's not used for authentication and authorization
 applications.
